      <p>
        Data are essential building blocks of scholarship and research. Being
        able to share data effectively is therefore extremely important. At
        DataCite, we develop and support tools and methods that make data
        more accessible and more useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        We <%= link_to 'invite members', '#join' %> from all types of
        organisations – including data centres, publishers, libraries, and
        funders – to join our global network committed to supporting data
        sharing through partnership, advocacy, and by developing tools and
        services that accelerate data sharing, use, and reuse. Together, we
        will be at the forefront of helping to transform scholarship and the
        role of research data in our society.
       </p>

      <p>
        As a <%= link_to 'DataCite member', 'members.html' %>, organisations
        show their support for research data sharing in the following manner:
      </p>
      <p>
        - They demonstrate an elevated level of commitment to open-data and
        open research.
        <br />
        - They become part of a global data-sharing community, learning,
        collaborating, and advocating with a leading-edge network of data
        research experts.
        <br />
        - They support and participate in the creation and management of
        persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research outputs (Allocating
        Members only).
        <br />
        - They play a critical role in advancing DataCite’s data-sharing
        mission through their financial support.
        <br />
        - They can also shape the future DataCite – and data research in
        general – by serving on our Executive Board.

                    Data sharing is an increasingly important issue in the
                    research community. At DataCite, we understand and share
                    the specific goals of data centres, which include
                    user-friendly submission processes, wider implementation
                    of citation formats and standards, new cooperation services
                    with publishers and libraries, and a common system of
                    credit and recognition for data production and sharing. We
                    also educate researchers in the mechanics and benefits of
                    citing data.

                    Authors increasingly need journals to provide access to the
                    data behind their research papers. At DataCite, we work
                    with publishers to create, support, and promote the
                    infrastructure for enabling data sharing and discovery (in
                    particular, by facilitating partnerships between publishers
                    and data centres/repositories). Together with publishers,
                    we provide tools and services that help facilitate and
                    promote data sharing, which, in turn, increases the impact,
                    the number of citations, and the prestige of publications.

                    Having an infrastructure for data preservation is easier –
                    and more cost-effective in the long run – than data
                    regeneration. Moreover, extending that infrastructure to
                    boost data sharing allows research organisations and
                    libraries to increase their level of support to researchers
                    and other data generators. With DataCite, you have a
                    partner for promoting the benefits of data sharing. We can                     also take an active role in working with publishers and data
                    centres to establish an incentive system that credits and                     recognizes researchers for their shared data.

                    In recent years, many funding organisations have mandated
                    data sharing as part of their grant-funding initiatives. By
                    providing a registry of DOIs, DataCite helps organisations
                    overcome the challenge of tracking data related to funding
                    and allows them to better understand the impact of their
                    funding.

			<h2>Annual membership</h2> 
			
      <p>
        DataCite membership is open to any organisation who support DataCite's
        <%= link_to 'data-sharing mission', 'mission.html' %>. Annual 
        membership dues have been set at <strong>2,000€</strong>.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Organizations that allocate DOIs must pay a service fee and member 
        dues. This class of members are allocating members and they can be
        non-profit or for-profit organisations.
			</p>	
			
			<h2>Non-profits</h2> 
				
			<p>	
				For non-profit allocating organizations,
        we propose a service fee that is based on two variables: the number of
        data centres the allocating member works with annually and the number 
        of DOIs created annually by the allocating member and data centres 
        associated with it.

			<h2>For-profits</h2> 
			
			<p>
			  For allocating members from for profit 
        organizations we propose a service fee that is based on the annual 
        revenue (self-reported) of the organization. For profit organizations 
        will also pay member dues. In addition, we propose to also have a 
        category for “start-ups” to account for newly established businesses. 
        This category will be determined on a case by case basis.
