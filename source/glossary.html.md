**API**: (Application Programming Interface) is a set of methods that make possible the communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a new service by providing all the building blocks. DataCite is redesigning its APIs to follow standards and make them more consistent.

**Docker**: Docker is a tool to abstract and automate the deployment of applications. It creates software containers and simplifies set-up/update processes. DataCite is migrating all its services to run with Docker. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).

**Event Data**: The Event Data service retrieves and exposes the activity that occurs around research data objects. In particular, Event Data brings to light links between publications and data, citations, software, reuse, documentation, etc. [Read more here](https://www.datacite.org/eventdata.html).

**Metadata Store**: (or MDS) is a service for data publishers to create and manage DOIs and register associated metadata. [Read more here](https://www.datacite.org/dois.html).

**Single sign-on**: (SSO) provides users with a single set of credentials (user and password) to gain access to any connected system. Depending on its credentials, each user can have access to different functionalities, generating a safer environment. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on).

**Solr**: is a search platform. It provides real-time indexing, full-text search, facets, hit highlighting, database integration, and other features. It is used by DataCite Search. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Solr).
