# What is a User Story?

In software development, user stories are informal, natural language descriptions of features. They are written from the perspective of end-users and other stakeholders (clients, managers or developers). In our case, most of them are written from the perspective of members, data centers, repository managers, and researchers.

# How are they used?

The DataCite team is collecting user stories to help us better understand the needs and requirements of the community and to prepare our [development roadmap](/roadmap.html). They help us shape our new services and tools, and to set priorities.

# User Story Structure

As a __1__, I want __2__, so that __3__.

1. Who are we building it for, who the user is? — As a <type of user>
1. What are we building, what is the intention? — I want <some goal or objective >
1. Why are we building it, what value it bring for the user.? — So that <benefit, value>

# Background on User Stories presented below

The user stories presented below were prepared by the DataCite team from information and feedback we have heard from members over the past year -- feedback via support@datacite.org, Open Hours and one-on-one conversations. Regardless, they form an initial collection of items we hope to expand and detail with your help.

We have grouped the user stories into broad categories and these are there to organize the content and help you include your suggestions.

# How to provide feedback

Feel free to edit this document and include new rows, add comments and suggestions. You are also more than welcome to rearrange them or create new categories. We include a few examples on how to provide feedback, they are highlighted in red.
