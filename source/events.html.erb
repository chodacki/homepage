			<h2>Zotero for Data Repositories Webinar - Tuesday, May 10, 2016 at 5:00 PM CEST</h3>
			<p>
				<%= link_to 'Recording available', 'https://blog.datacite.org/zotero-for-data-repositories-webinar/' %>

			<p>Sebastian Karcher is the associate director of the Qualitative Data Repository, where he works on data sharing for 
				qualitative social science research. He is an expert on scholarly referencing and citation workflows and has been a 
				longtime contributor to the Citation Style Language as well as Zotero, the open source reference management software. 
				In this webinar, he will provide us insights about how Zotero fetches metadata from data repositories. He will cover 
				several examples such as Dataverse or Dryad Digital Repository and explain how repositories can facilitate integration 
				with reference managers in general and Zotero specifically. The webinar will also include pointers for individuals 
				interesting in contributing to the Zotero translator infrastructure.

			<h2>DC2AP and DC2RDF Webinar - Tuesday, April 12, 2016 at 4:30 PM CEST</h3>
			<p>
				<%= link_to 'Recording available', 'https://blog.datacite.org/dc2ap-and-dc2rdf-webinar/' %><br />
			</p>
			
			<p>The DataCite Metadata Working Group has prepared a DataCite to Dublin Core application profile (DC2AP) and a DataCite 
				Ontology (DC2RDF) and would love to hear your comments about it! The profile will help you building Dublin Core 
				compatible DataCite metadata records, using Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) metadata terms and other ontologies. </p>
			<p>The Metadata Working Group seeks public review as the first step to become a DCMI Community Specification. Feedback 
				from potential users and developers is strongly encouraged and it will help us improving the interoperability and quality 
				of DataCiteâ€™s metadata.</p>
