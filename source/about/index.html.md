We are a not-for-profit organisation formed in London on 1 December 2009. Our aim is to:

* establish easier access to research data on the Internet
* increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scholarly record
* support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study.

These goals are laid down in the DataCite statutes (PDF).

## Our structure

Just as research is global, DataCite is global, with member institutions offering services and advice directly where they are needed by the researchers.

We consist of a Managing Agent, currently the German National Library of Science and Technology, with Members and Associate Members around the world. DataCite is represented by its Board Members.
