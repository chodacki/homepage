We want to help make data more accessible and more useful; our purpose is to develop and support methods to locate, identify and cite data and other research objects. Specifically, we develop and support the standards behind persistent identifiers for data, and our members assign them.

We bring together actors from the research community to address the challenges of making research objects visible and accessible. Together we constitute a global network of dataset researchers. Members of DataCite meet in person every six months at summer and winter conferences, and collaborate in established working groups.

Through collaboration, we:

* support researchers by helping them to find, identify, and cite research data and other research objects with confidence;
* support data centres by providing persistent identifiers for datasets, workflows and standards for data publication;
* support journal publishers by enabling research articles to be linked to the underlying data/objects.

Currently we are working primarily with organisations that host data, such as data centres and libraries.

## Assigning persistent identifiers to datasets

By working with data centres to assign persistent identifiers to datasets and other research objects, we are developing an infrastructure that supports simple and effective methods of data citation, discovery, and access. Citable data become legitimate contributions to scholarly communication, paving the way for new metrics and publication models that recognise and reward data sharing.

Initially we are leveraging the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) infrastructure, which is well-established and already widely used for identifying research articles. We take an open approach, however, and consider other identifier systems and services that help forward our objectives. DataCite best practice is for DOIs to resolve to a public landing page that contains information about the associated dataset or other research object and a direct link to the object itself.

## DataCite services, resources and events

DataCite has developed a number of services and resources to support its aims. DataCite meetings and other events are held regularly.
Among these is the DataCite Metadata Store for data publishers who want to mint DOIs and register associated metadata.
