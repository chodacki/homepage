# Introduction

This page provides an overview of the DataCite development roadmap for 2017. It
details the list of projects, their requirements and impact, as well as their
current status.

Last year, DataCite focused on building backend services with the outcome of
increased reliability. In the coming months, we will be transitioning to a
redesign of the Metadata Store (MDS) and the development of new member-facing
services. This shift is reflected in the roadmap as the backend and consolidation
tasks are nearing completion and as the design and development of new member-facing
functions ramp up.

The Roadmap was developed by the DataCite team taking into account the user
stories provided by members, General Assembly feedback, priorities set by the
DataCite Board and Services Steering Group, combined with DataCiteâ€™s resources.

For a more detailed view of the roadmap and associated user stories, go to the
DataCite GitHub repository or the waffle.io board.go to the

comments, feedback or questions, please contact us at

# Glossary

**API**: (Application Programming Interface) is a set of methods that make possible the communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a new service by providing all the building blocks. DataCite is redesigning its APIs to follow standards and make them more consistent. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).

**Docker**: Docker is a tool to abstract and automate the deployment of applications. It creates software containers and simplifies set-up/update processes. DataCite is migrating all its services to run with Docker. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).

**Event Data**: The Event Data service retrieves and exposes the activity that occurs around research data objects. In particular, Event Data brings to light links between publications and data, citations, software, reuse, documentation, etc. [Read more here](https://www.datacite.org/eventdata.html).

**Metadata Store**: (or MDS) is a service for data publishers to create and manage DOIs and register associated metadata. [Read more here](https://www.datacite.org/dois.html).

**Single sign-on**: (SSO) provides users with a single set of credentials (user and password) to gain access to any connected system. Depending on its credentials, each user can have access to different functionalities, generating a safer environment. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on).

**Solr**: is a search platform. It provides real-time indexing, full-text search, facets, hit highlighting, database integration, and other features. It is used by DataCite Search. [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Solr).
