# Introduction

This page provides an overview of the DataCite development roadmap. It
details the list of projects, their requirements and impact, as well as their
current status.

The Roadmap was developed by the DataCite team taking into account the [user
stories](/user-stories.html) provided by members, General Assembly feedback,
priorities set by the DataCite Board and Services Steering Group, combined with
DataCiteâ€™s resources. The roadmap is regularly updated based on this input.

For a more detailed view of the roadmap and associated user stories, go to the
[DataCite GitHub repository](https://github.com/datacite/datacite) or go the
[DataCite waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/datacite/datacite). If you have any
comments, feedback or questions, please contact us at
[support@datacite.org](mailto:support@datacite.org).
