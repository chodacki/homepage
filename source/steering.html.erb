    <h1>a community driven organisation</h1>
    <p>
      DataCite is a community driven organization, and we encourage involvement
      from people that share our data sharing vision. To help guide and support
      our growth and our ongoing development, DataCite has formed three
      Steering Groups: Sustainability and Business, Services and Technology,
      and Community and Engagement. Our Steering Groups provide a venue
      for open participation by interested community members and help us with
      priority setting and identify strategies related to sustainability
      planning, services, and outreach.
    </p>
    <h1>sustainability and business steering group (sbsg)</h1>
    <p>
      The SBSG is responsible for reviewing, modifying and suggesting policies
      and best practices that support DataCite’s membership, services, and
      products. The group is also responsible for advising on DataCite’s
      financial models and recommending strategies to ensure DataCite’s
      sustainability. The SBSG aligns its work with SSG and OSG so that
      policies support technical and service development and provide a
      consistent message to the wider research community.
