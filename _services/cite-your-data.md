Why is it so important to cite data? Books and journal articles have long benefited from an infrastructure that makes them easy to cite, a key element in the process of research and academic discourse. We believe that you should cite data in just the same way that you can cite other sources of information, such as articles and books. Data citation can help by:

* enabling easy reuse and verification of data
* allowing the impact of data to be tracked
* creating a scholarly structure that recognises and rewards data producers

## Examples of data citation

We recognise that the challenges associated with data publication vary across disciplines, and we encourage research communities to develop citation systems that work well for them. Our recommended format for data citation is as follows:

> Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Publisher. Identifier

It may also be desirable to include information about two optional properties, Version and  ResourceType (as appropriate). If so, the recommended form is as follows:

> Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Version. Publisher.  ResourceType. Identifier

For citation purposes, DataCite recommends that DOI names are displayed as linkable, permanent URLs. For example:

* Irino, T; Tada, R (2009): Chemical and mineral compositions of sediments from ODP Site 127‐797. Geological Institute, University of
  Tokyo. http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.726855
* Geofon operator (2009): GEFON event gfz2009kciu (NW Balkan Region). GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam
 (GFZ). http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/GFZ.GEOFON.gfz2009kciu
* Denhard, Michael (2009): dphase_mpeps: MicroPEPS LAF‐Ensemble run by DWD for the MAP D‐PHASE project. World Data Center for
  Climate. http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/WDCC/dphase_mpeps
