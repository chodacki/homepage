The Harvard Library’s holdings range from traditional print collections to
rapidly expanding digital resources. It is the mission of the Harvard Library
to provide the University's faculty, students, and researchers — now and in the
future — with comprehensive access to all of its collections and the overall
record of scholarship.

In collaboration with the Harvard Library, the Harvard Dataverse Network offers
DataCite DOIs via the EZID service. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are assigned
to research datasets, and then registered with DataCite to establish persistence.
The Harvard Dataverse Network, powered by the Dataverse Network software developed
at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS), is a repository that is
open to all scientific data, from all disciplines worldwide. It includes the
world's largest collection of social science research data.
