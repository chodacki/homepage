The task of the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) is to build the
Australian Research Data Commons by creating the infrastructure to enable
Australian researchers to easily publish, discover, access and reuse research data.

Our approach is to engage in partnerships with research institutions to encourage
better local data management, which enables structured collections to be created
and information about these collections to be published via Research Data Australia,
a discovery service provided by ANDS to help researchers to find and access
Australian research data. It contains descriptions of research data that is
held by contributing organisations and institutions.

ANDS involvement in the DataCite consortium ensures that we are active in
global initiatives addressing the issues surrounding research data, including
those of publication, citation and standards. ANDS has run its Cite My Data
service since 2011. This service allows Australian research organisations to
assign DOIs to their own research collections. This, in turn, provides researchers
with a means of citing their published data and achieving recognition for
their research data output.
